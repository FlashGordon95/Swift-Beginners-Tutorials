 //The first two concepts we'll cover is printing to the console and a brief introduction to 'vars'!
 //A var is a way we can store data in a programming language, there are a number of different types of vars which we will cover however the basic concept is that its just something that you can name, that can save some form of data.
var str = "Hello, playground"
 
 //To print to the console we simply use the print() command! Anything inside the parantheses is what will get printed to the console. 
 
 //In this example we're just going to take our str from above and print that.
 print(str)
 
 //That being said we can also print out our own static text if we like:
 print("Hello, World!!")

 //See that? Not even 5 minutes and you've already written your first program!
